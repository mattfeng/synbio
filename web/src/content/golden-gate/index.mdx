# Golden Gate Assembly

Golden Gate assembly is a molecular cloning method that ligates multiple DNA fragments together _in desired order_ using a single restriction enzyme _without any undesired extra bases_ (known as **scarring**) left over from cloning.

Here's an example:

If we have the following three plasmids, and we want to assemble them in the order, how could we do it?

But wait: **how do we make sure the Type IIS recognition and cut sites exist?**

We can actually add the recognition and cut sites using PCR.

How do we make sure that our plasmids don't have any extra bases though?

We can then
