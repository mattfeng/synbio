# Commonly used cell lines

## HEK293
- Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells
- Frank Graham transfected DNA from adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) into HEK cells; it took 293 experiments before he succeeded in immortalizing a cell
  - DNA from Ad5 integrated into chromosome 19
- Originated from a **female fetus**
- Characterization: https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5767
  - Resembles adrenal cells
  - Adrenal cells are similar to neuronal cells
  - HEK293 cells routinely carry 64 chromosomes

### Derived cell lines
- HEK293T
  - Introduce viral SV40 large T antigen
  - Enables replication of transfected plasmids with SV40 origin of replication
    - makes HEK293T cells attractive for producing large amounts of recombinant proteins or viral particles, as high plasmid levels can be reached by transient transfections.
- HEK293F
  - HEK293 and HEK293T are adherent cell lines
    - they form a stable connection with coated cell culture dishes which limits their volume to a two-dimensional space
  - HEK293F cells can be cultured in suspension
    - elevates them to 3D space and allowing for more efficient growth of high-density cell cultures for recombinant protein production in bioreactors
- HEK293FT
  - merges benefits from HEK293T and HEK293F by introducing the SV40 large T antigen into HEK293F cells
- HEK293SG
- deserves to be mentioned. Stemming from the suspension-cultured HEK293S cell line, HEK293SG are designed to produce homogeneously glycosylated biopharmaceuticals by the deletion of MGAT, a key chokepoint of the glycosylation machinery.
