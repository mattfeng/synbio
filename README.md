_Synthetic biology_.

## Methods
- [Golden Gate assembly.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003647)
  - Current cloning technologies based on site-specific recombination have the drawback of leaving recombination site sequences in the final construct, adding an extra 8 to 13 amino acids to the expressed protein.
  - Golden Gate assembly transfers any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming. 

## Tools
- [iBioSim 3: A tool for model-based genetic circuit design](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00078)

## Equipment
- [Ambr250 Bioreactors (Fermenters)](https://www.sartorius.com/en/products/fermentation-bioreactors/ambr-multi-parallel-bioreactors/ambr-250-high-throughput)

## Cell lines
- CHO cells
  - used to express recombinant proteins (often recombinant protein therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies)
- HEK293
  - Human embryonic kidney cells
  - Used for preparing Ad vaccines
