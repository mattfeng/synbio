## Methods
- [Golden Gate assembly.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003647)
  - Current cloning technologies based on site-specific recombination have the drawback of leaving recombination site sequences in the final construct, adding an extra 8 to 13 amino acids to the expressed protein.
  - Golden Gate assembly transfers any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming.
